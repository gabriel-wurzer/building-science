"# building-science"

some stuff that I did in the class ".data integration" for building science

## occupancy sensor (see that forlder)

1. install a web server on your phone (I have "Simple HTTP Server" on android)
2. copy index.html to the web server's root directory
3. start server (I am assuming localhost:8080)
4. open that in a modern browser (I have Chrome)
5. when being asked if you want to allow the camera, place the phone in a door passage and click allow WITHOUT BEING IN THE IMAGE
6. observe how the occupancy number change when you go through the door
